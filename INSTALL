INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

Just type
    doas make install
to install the software!

Quick tip: to avoid typing your password everytime you use this tool, put this:

    #!/bin/sh
    doas network $1 $2

in "network" in your personal bin directory, and then add the following line
to your /etc/doas.conf file:

    permit nopass <username> as root cmd network

Now, when you type "network", it will be run as root without asking for your
password.


UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
===================

Just type
    doas make update
and then review the changes to the configuration file, if needed.


UNINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
======================

Just type
    doas make uninstall
and then manually remove /etc/networks.conf if you don't need it anymore.
